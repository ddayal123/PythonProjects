# PythonProjects
# ATM GUI Project 
**Due Date: Wednesday, November 11, 2020, 11:59pm**

You will write a program that simulates an ATM. Your program should present a user with the following options:
- Make deposits 
- Make withdrawals
- Check account balance

Your program should use radiobuttons or some single selection widget. For deposits and withdrawals, your code should correctly add/deduct from the balance. Your check balance should reflect the correctly updated balance. You should have a Proceed/Continue button to proceed with user selections and a Quit/Exit button to quit your application. 

You are free to add visually appeasing elements as you choose but your GUI should perform as described first and foremost.
